Designed and developed a location-based disaster management communication system focused on flood-prone areas in India. The platform provides real-time collaboration through separate chatrooms for different stakeholders — citizens, emergency responders, government agencies, and NGOs — enabling focused, role-specific conversations.
Key features include:
Dynamic chatrooms categorized by stakeholder and specific disaster-related issues.
Interactive map integration for selecting locations and sending geo-tagged messages (with latitude, longitude, and place name).
Problem-based messaging to streamline relief coordination.
Image uploads within chats to share live updates or evidence from affected zones.
This solution addresses the common challenges in disaster management like delayed alerts, fragmented communication, and slow emergency response. It encourages community participation while enhancing coordination across all involved entities.
